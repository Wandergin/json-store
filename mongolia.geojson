In 1778 the Mongolian governor of Khuree (Urga, present day Ulan-Bator) Sanzaidorj requested approval of annual ceremonies to Bogd Khairkhan from Qianlong Emperor. The letter and reply from Beijing in Mongolian is kept in the Central State Archives of Mongolia. The deity associated with Bogd Khan is Dunjingarav, a ferocious male, who rides thirty-three grey horses (a symbol of shamanism) and has the mantra (a ritual originating in Buddhism) “um ma hum”. The sutra created by Triumphant Abbot Damtsagdorj (1781-1855) is currently used in worship rituals."

The mountain has had a strong religious significance since being designated as such by Chinggis Khan in the twelfth century. The Khentii Province is believed to be the birthplace of Chinggis Khan in or around 1162, and Burkhan Khaldun Mountain is where he performed his ceremonies and communicated with his protector spirits and the Tengeri. Worship was formalized by Presidential Decree in 1995 and was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 4 July 2015."
